# The-Ultimate-Python-Course-by-AryanKumarMohanty


Welcome to my coding journey! I am learning programming step-by-step and sharing my progress here. This repository contains all chapters, projects, and mega projects from the course Iâ€™m following.

## Course Plan

- I will complete **one chapter every day** instead of spending just one hour daily.
- There are **9 chapters**, **2 projects**, and **2 mega projects** in total.
- This structured approach will help me learn consistently and build real-world skills.

## Resources

I am learning with the help of the **CodeWithHarry YouTube channel** and other resources, applying the concepts through practical projects.

## Repository Contents

- **Chapters:** Detailed code and notes for each chapter.
- **Projects:** Hands-on coding projects to solidify understanding.
- **Mega Projects:** Larger applications to challenge and showcase my skills.

## Follow Along

Feel free to explore the code, give feedback, or even contribute! You can also follow my progress on my YouTube channel:
